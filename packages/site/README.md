# Anzen frontend

Anzen is a Smart Contract wallet secured by 2FA. Our goal is to make sure that users never lose their funds, even if their private key is stolen!

Anzen was built during the ETHGlobal hackathon at ETHBogot√°.

You can try Anzen on https://faktoro-7469a.web.app/ but please remember this is a beta version and may run into unexpected errors.

The code for the frontend is in `packages/site`. Please ignore the rest of the repo and we're very sorry for the mess.

## Compatible Networks 

Anzen works on the following networks:  
- Polygon  
- Optimism  
- Etherem  
- Arbitrum  
- Celo  
- Avalanche  
- Gnosis Chain  

We did most of our testing on Polygon and Optimism.
